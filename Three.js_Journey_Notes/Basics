Creating a scene & item:
const scene = new THREE.Scene()

const sphereGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1.5, 32, 32)

We always need these 4 elements to produce something on the screen: 
-Scene
-Object
-Camera
-Renderer

a mesh is the cominbation of a geometry(the shape) and a material (how it looks)

A Box & material:
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 })
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)

scene.add(mesh)



 














Camera: 

The camera is not visible. You can have multiple cameras. 

PerspectiveCamera-making close objects look more prominent than far objects
	-it takes 2 parameters: field of view, aspect ratio



























Position an object:

mesh.position.x = 0.3    //(left/right)
mesh.position.y = -0.6  //(upward)
mesh.position.z = 1     //(forward/backward)






Sizing an object:

mesh.scale.x = 2
mesh.scale.y = 0.25
mesh.scale.z = 0.5








Rotating an Object: 
	-2 ways (rotation property and quaternion)

the rotation property also has x, y, and z properties, but instead of a Vector3, it's a Euler. When you change the 
x, y, and z properties of a Euler, you can imagine putting a stick through your object's center in the axis's 
direction and then rotating that object on that stick.

If you spin on the y axis, you can picture it like a carousel.
If you spin on the x axis, you can imagine that you are rotating the wheels of a car you'd be in.
And if you rotate on the z axis, you can imagine that you are rotating the propellers in front of an aircraft you'd be in.
The value of these axes is expressed in radians. If you want to achieve half a rotation, you'll have to write 
something like 3.14159... You probably recognize that number as π. In native JavaScript, you can end up with an 
approximation of π using Math.PI.

mesh.rotation.x = Math.PI * 0.25
mesh.rotation.y = Math.PI * 0.25









Quaternion (more prefered way to rotate objects)














Group items when it's the same items. saves you from editing each item indivualy.
