How to get react onto page: 

In HTML document write a div: 
ex. <div id="root"></div>


In JS file write: ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello, everyone</h1>,document.getElementById('root'))




You have to wrap elements in a div if you have 1+ elements in jsx: 
    ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
        <h1 className="header">This is JSX</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </div>,
    document.getElementById("root")
)













How to import React without using global variables: 

JavaScript: 

import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"


const page = (
    <div>
        <h1>Top Dog Breeds</h1>
        <h3>Top Dog Breeds in US</h3>
            <li>Pomsky</li>
            <li>Pug</li>
            <li>Retreiver</li>
        </div>

)
ReactDOM.render(page, document.getElementbyId("root").  <----just using root from HTML above
                                                                  
                                                                  
Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
React is what defines JSX
                                                                  
                                                                  
                                                                  
 What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do 
and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means I need
to tell it HOW to do each step.
