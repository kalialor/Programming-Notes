Next.js allows for server side rendering of your React application. You can also use it to create static websites. It is an alternative to Gatsby. 



What is server-side rendering? 
It allows the application to be rendered on the server on the first page load. This gives a lot of benefits such as data fetching methods, APi Routes, better performance, and great for SEO because search engines can actually see your content. 


Next.js is both front & back-end
It does have backend capabilities to handle requeest response, you can create your own API routes, and so on. 

Vercel is the creator of Next


Next allows for easy page routing
There's no need to install React Router DOM and manually create your routes. You simply put compoents into a Pages folder. 


Next also has TypeScript and Sass. If you want to use Typescript, you can rename your 'js' files to 'ts'
