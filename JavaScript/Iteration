The process of repeatedly executing a block of code for a specific number of times or until a certain condition is met. There are several ways to iterate through arrays and other collections of data in JavaScript, including for loops, for-of loops, for-in loops, and array methods such as 'forEach(),' 'map()', and 'reduce()'





For example, a 'for' loop can be used to iterate through an array and print out each element: 

let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];

for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   console.log(arr[i]);
}
     The output would be numbers 1 through 5
