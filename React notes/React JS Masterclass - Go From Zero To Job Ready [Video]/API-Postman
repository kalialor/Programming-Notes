HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)-is a stateless protocol. 

GET-getting data from server. 
POST-making a post



Contraints for an API to be considered RESTful:

Client-Server Architecture
Statelessness-remembering data
Cacheability
Layered System
Code on Demand
Uniform Interface




HTTP Verbs               CRUD
GET			READ          Retrieves Resources
POST			Create        Creates resources
PUT			Update       Changes and/or replaces resources or collections
Patch		
DELETE			Delete       Deletes resources













curl is a command that we can run from our terminal
you need to install curl in terminal

Collections are places to organize your API requests in Postman.









First things first: a librarian must know how to view all the books in the library catalog.

According to the API documentation, you can get all the books in the library by making a request to GET https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books. Here, GET is the request method and the url is the request URL. We'll cover what that means soon - but first let's get our hands dirty with our first request!




Request methods
When we make an HTTP call to a server, we specify a request method that indicates the type of operation we are about to perform. These are also called HTTP verbs.

Here are some common HTTP request methods that correspond to the CRUD operations mentioned earlier. You can see a list of more methods here.

Method name	                  Operation
GET	                        Retrieve data (Read)
POST	                    Send data (Create)
PUT/PATCH	                 Update data (Update)

* PUT usually replaces an entire resource, whereas PATCH usually is for partial updates
DELETE	Delete data (Delete)











Remember that the minimum ingredients you need to make a request are:

a request method (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, etc)
a request URL

Some APIs allow you to refine your request further with key-value pairs called query parameters.
