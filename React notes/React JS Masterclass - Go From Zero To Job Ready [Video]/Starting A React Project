npx create react app my app 
cd my app
npm start









npx: npx is a package runner tool that comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager). It allows you to run packages without installing them globally. In this case, it's used to execute the create-react-app package without explicitly installing it beforehand. 

create-react-app: create-react-app is a command-line tool used to bootstrap a new React application with a basic project structure and configuration. It sets up everything you need to start building a React application, including the necessary dependencies and development environment.

my-app: my-app is the name you give to your React application. You can replace it with any name you prefer. When you run this command, a new directory with the specified name will be created, containing the initial React application files.




npx is to execute something
npm is to manage something




delete src folder. then create src folder. create index.html 

index.html:

import React from "react";

import "./index.css";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>    //activates additional checks & warnings
);

import './App.css';

export default function App() {
    const username = "Kalia";
