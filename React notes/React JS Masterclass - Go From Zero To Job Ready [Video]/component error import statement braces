Yes, that's correct. When a component is exported using `export default`, it is considered a default export. In this case, when you import the component, you don't need to use curly braces and can import it directly as a default import.

For example, if you have a component exported like this:

```javascript
export default function Home() {
  // Component implementation
}
```

You can import it without using curly braces:

```javascript
import Home from "./Home";
```

However, if the component is exported without the `default` keyword, it is considered a named export. In this case, when you import the component, you need to use curly braces and specify the exact name of the exported component.

For example, if you have a component exported like this:

```javascript
export function Home() {
  // Component implementation
}
```

You need to import it using curly braces:

```javascript
import { Home } from "./Home";
```

By following these guidelines, you ensure that you import the correct type of export (default or named) and use the appropriate syntax in your import statements.
