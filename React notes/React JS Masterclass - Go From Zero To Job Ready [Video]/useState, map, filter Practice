Certainly! Here's another example that demonstrates the usage of `useState`, `map`, and `filter` with an array of objects representing books:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function BookList() {
  const [books, setBooks] = useState([
    { id: 1, title: 'Harry Potter', author: 'J.K. Rowling' },
    { id: 2, title: 'The Lord of the Rings', author: 'J.R.R. Tolkien' },
    { id: 3, title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird', author: 'Harper Lee' },
    { id: 4, title: 'Pride and Prejudice', author: 'Jane Austen' },
  ]);

  const filteredBooks = books.filter(book => book.author === 'J.K. Rowling');
  const bookTitles = books.map(book => book.title);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>All Books</h3>
      <ul>
        {books.map(book => (
          <li key={book.id}>
            {book.title} by {book.author}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <h3>Books by J.K. Rowling</h3>
      <ul>
        {filteredBooks.map(book => (
          <li key={book.id}>
            {book.title} by {book.author}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <h3>Book Titles</h3>
      <ul>
        {bookTitles.map((title, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BookList;
```

In this example, we have an array of book objects stored in the `books` state variable using `useState`. Each book object has properties such as `id`, `title`, and `author`.

We then use `filter` to create a new array called `filteredBooks`, which contains only the books written by J.K. Rowling. The `filter` function checks if the `author` property of each book object matches `'J.K. Rowling'`. If it does, that book is included in the `filteredBooks` array.

Next, we use `map` to create a new array called `bookTitles`, which contains only the titles of the books from the `books` array. The `map` function transforms each book object into its `title` property, creating an array of book titles.

In the component's return statement, we render three lists:
- The original book list, which displays each book's title and author from the `books` array.
- The books by J.K. Rowling list, which displays the titles and authors of the books from the `filteredBooks` array.
- The book titles list, which displays each book title from the `bookTitles` array.

By using `map` and `filter` in combination with the `useState` hook, we can manipulate and display data dynamically in React components based on certain conditions or requirements.
