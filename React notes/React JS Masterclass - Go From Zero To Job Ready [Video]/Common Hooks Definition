Understanding when to use certain React hooks can indeed be challenging for beginners. Here's a brief explanation of the commonly used hooks and the scenarios where they are typically useful:

1. `useState`: This hook is used to add state to functional components. It allows you to declare and manage state variables within the component. Use `useState` when you need to store and update a value that will trigger re-rendering of the component when it changes.

2. `useRef`: This hook creates a mutable reference that persists across renders. It's commonly used to access and store values that don't cause re-renders. Use `useRef` when you need to store a value that you want to access later without triggering re-rendering.

3. `useEffect`: This hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects include data fetching, subscribing to event listeners, or manually interacting with the DOM. Use `useEffect` when you need to perform an action after rendering or when specific dependencies change.

4. `useCallback`: This hook is used to memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-creations. It's useful when you have a function that you want to pass as a prop to child components and ensure that it remains the same across renders unless its dependencies change.

5. `useMemo`: This hook is used to memoize values and prevent unnecessary recalculations. It's helpful when you have a value that is computationally expensive to compute and you want to cache it until its dependencies change.

6. `useContext`: This hook is used to access the value of a context provided by a `Context.Provider`. It allows you to consume context values within functional components, avoiding prop drilling.

Remember that these are general guidelines, and there can be variations based on specific use cases. It's essential to understand the purpose and behavior of each hook and consider the specific requirements of your component when deciding which hooks to use. The React documentation provides detailed explanations and examples for each hook, which can be a valuable resource to further deepen your understanding.
