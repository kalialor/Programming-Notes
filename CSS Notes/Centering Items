To align an element to the center of the page using CSS, you can use a combination of flexbox and the `justify-content` and `align-items` properties. Here's an example:

HTML:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="centered-element">
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
html, body {
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
}

.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
}

.centered-element {
  /* Add any styles you want for the centered element */
}
```

Explanation:
- The `container` class is used as a wrapper to center the element. It uses `display: flex;` to create a flex container.
- `justify-content: center;` aligns the content horizontally at the center of the flex container.
- `align-items: center;` aligns the content vertically at the center of the flex container.
- The `centered-element` class represents the element you want to center. You can add any additional styles you need to this class.

By setting the `container` class to occupy the full height of the page (`height: 100%;`) and using flexbox properties, the element with the `centered-element` class will be centered both horizontally and vertically within the page.
