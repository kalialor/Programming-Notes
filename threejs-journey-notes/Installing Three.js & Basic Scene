Use a bundler rather than inputting the links on the HTML & JavaScript file.

You can use a bundler to create a local server, manage dependencies, improve compatibility, support modules, optimize images, deploy on a server, minify the code, etc. 


Webpack is currently the most popular bundler. It can handle most of your needs and provide extensive documentation and a constructive community.


-Go to project folder in the terminal: npm install

-npm install, installs dependencies like Three.js

Then type in npm run dev to start the server





Some notes:

You don't need to add js file to HTML file. Webpack does it automatically.

You need to load the CSS file to the JS file








BASIC SCENE


We want to get our scene back in this Webpack template.

First, you need to add the <canvas> to the src/index.html file:




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>04 - Webpack</title>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas class="webgl"></canvas>
</body>
</html>
