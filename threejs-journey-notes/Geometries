Geometries are composed of vertices (point coordinates in 3D space) and faces (triangles that join those vertices to create a surface).

We use geometries to create meshes, but you can also use geometries to form particles.


You're not going to move the mesh, you're going to move the vertices of the geometry.



**We already made a cube, but we didn't talk much about the parameters. Most geometeries have parameters, and you should always look at the docs before using it. 



BoxGeometry has 6 parameters: 

width: The size on the x axis
height: The size on the y axis
depth: the size on the z axis
widthSegmets: how many subdivisions in the x axis
heightSegments: How many subdivisions in the y axis 
depthSegments: How many subdivisions in the z axis
