a namespace contains types like classes to group them together
    -ex: System is a namespace
        -it's like an address 
            -ex: NewHaven.ProspectSt.KaliaLor
                    -System.Console.WriteLine
                        -WriteLine is the method, console is the type, system is the namespace
                        -this example tells the complier to look for a method called WriteLine, in a type named console, in a namespace named System



a class contains the members of an object, including methods

a method contains statements that implement an action that an object can take






Animal and Car are types; they are nouns for categorizing things.
Head and Engine might be fields or properties; they are nouns that belong to Animal and Car.
Fido and Bob are variables; they are nouns for referring to a specific object.









Literal Notation/Value:
when you assign to a variable, you often assign a literal value
    -a literal is a notation that represents a fixed value





When you have one letter, use single quotes.
    char = 'A'


When you have multiple letters, use double quotes.
    string firstName = "Kalia"






string fullNameWithTabSeparator = "Kalia\tLor";
            //Kalia 
              Lor











But what if you are storing the path to a file on Windows, and one of the folder names starts with a T, as shown in the following code?

string filePath = "C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt";


The compiler will convert the \t into a tab character and you will get errors!

You must prefix with the @ symbol to use a verbatim literal string, as shown in the following code:

string filePath = @"C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt";








Literal string: Characters enclosed in double-quote characters. They can use escape characters like \t for tab. To represent a backslash, use two: \\.


Raw string literal: Characters enclosed in three or more double-quote characters.



Verbatim string: A literal string prefixed with @ to disable escape characters so that a backslash is a backslash. It also allows the string value to span multiple lines because the whitespace characters are treated as themselves instead of instructions to the compiler.



Interpolated string: A literal string prefixed with $ to enable embedded formatted variables. You will learn more about this later in this chapter.












Using var
-you can only use var in a method. you can't use it globally. 
-var will replace any data type. you don't need to type in string, bool, int, and so on...
-this is also called implicitly
-explicitly is typing out the data type. ex: int dogPuppies = 5;



public static void Main()
{
    //Implicitly
    var dogName = "Oliver"

}












//Task: create a program to swap 2 numbers

//variables
int firstNum = 1;
int secondNum = 2;


//logic
int temp = firstNum; // 1
firstNum = secondNum; // 2
secondNum = temp; // 1




//result
Console.WriteLine("firstNum is: " + firstNum + " and secondNum is: " + secondNum);







Bits/Bytes

Bits are smaller, either 0 or 1. <---binary number system
                                            
                                           
Humans use the decimal number system
     10 digits. with 10 as its base.
