decimal is a much larger amount of storage than a double is
for most operations we use double

you double for math, use decimal for money

we use decimal for money, and for large decimal units



*you have to put 'M' for decimal


ex: 

decimal bankAccountBalance;

bankAccountBalance = 2.34M;

Console.WriteLine(bankAccountBalance);
