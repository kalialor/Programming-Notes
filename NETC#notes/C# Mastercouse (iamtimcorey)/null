null is a lack of value


//Haven't asked for value yet
int? age = null;
bool? birthday = null;
double? battingAverage = null;



//We have asked for age now
age = 0;




use the '?' to make the variable a nullable variable. This is really useful for data. If you don't have yet have value for a column, you don't put a value there. You say null. 
We don't know the value yet. We are not going to put zero. Put null instead.
