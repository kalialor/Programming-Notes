//doubles can have a decimal point  - 1.23. 43

if you want double:


double averageAge;

averageAge = (43.0 + 22 + 62) /3;

Console.WriteLine(averageAge);     //42.33333






you don't want to divide int because it truncates the decimal point. use double instead.

this is the most common used thing for decimal




we do not use doubles to store money.
