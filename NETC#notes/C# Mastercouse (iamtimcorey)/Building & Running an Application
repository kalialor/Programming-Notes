C# code is not what the computer runs


When it is compiled, it is no longer C# code. It is compiled into what's called intermediate language. From there, it is executed using .NET Framework, Core, .NET or whatever you are using. So you will be left with an executable file.


***The solution is NOT the final project.



bin & obj folders are folders that gets created when you run a build

you can delete those folders.


obj is for resources
bin is for debug




Debug vs. Release


Leave it in Debug mode

Release is for production


Release is the most efficent possible, debug is for debugging


In general, start with debugging.  rather than start without debugging.
