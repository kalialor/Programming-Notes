.NET framework is a platform in which you build upon
    -you can use a lot of different languages to build on top of .NET framework
    -C#, VB, F#
    -it is currently still supported
    
CLR is in the .NET framework

F# is functional 
C# is Object-Orientied


.NET framework & .NET core are called abstraction layers, below of the languages





.NET Core
    -the layer below all of the other languages
    -the .NET framework got replaced by the .NET core
    -it is faster
    -.NET core is the new abstraction layer we are running under
    -.NET 3.1 and below is called .NET core and .NET 3.1 and above is called .NET
    -you can use .NET Core any Windows, Mac, & Linux
    
    
    
.NET Standard
    -bridges the gap between the 2 abstraction layers (.NET framework & .NET core)
    -also uses Xamerian and Unity
    -is going to go away eventually
    
    
-In the future we will have only 1 abstraction layer called .NET6









In summary, the languages are on the top (C#, VB, F#)
then it is complied down to the abraction layer you want
    -.NET Framework or .NET core
    -then from there it gets compiled in the just-in-time (JIT) compiler
